# 04 Go Module

## Prompt

Can you help me initialize the project as a go module with a go.mod file?

## Response

Absolutely. Go modules is the dependency management solution built into the Go toolchain, and it's recommended for all new projects as of Go 1.16. The central file in a Go module is go.mod, which tracks the module's dependencies.

To create a new Go module, navigate to your project's directory and run this command:

```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname
```

Replace yourusername with your GitHub username, and yourprojectname with the name of your repository on GitHub. This creates a go.mod file in the current directory, with the first line being module github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.

For example, if your GitHub username is "alice" and your repository name is "password-checker", you would run go mod init github.com/alice/password-checker.

After running go mod init, your go.mod file will look something like this:

```go
module github.com/alice/password-checker

go 1.17

```

Then, when you add a dependency to your project by importing it in your Go code and run your project with go run . or build it with go build, Go will automatically add the required dependency to the go.mod file and download the required module to the Go module cache.

For example, after adding the spf13/cobra library to your project and running the project, your go.mod file will look something like this:

```go
module github.com/alice/password-checker

go 1.17

require github.com/spf13/cobra v1.2.1
```

In your case, you need to add github.com/spf13/cobra to your go.mod file, and you can do this by importing the cobra package in your code, as shown in the previous examples, and then running or building your project.

Note that the Go version in the go.mod file is the minimum Go version required to build your project. It doesn't have to be the version you're currently using.
