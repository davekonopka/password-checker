# 13 Test Failures

## Prompt

Thanks. When I add these tests and run `go test` I'm getting failures:

```
--- FAIL: TestCli (0.85s)
    main_test.go:21: Expected 0
        , got [50 10]
Invalid number of arguments
--- FAIL: TestDaemon (1.03s)
    main_test.go:33: Expected no error, got Get "http://localhost:8080/check/password": dial tcp [::1]:8080: connect: connection refused

## Response

My apologies for the confusion, and thank you for bringing this to my attention. The issues you're encountering are due to the following reasons:

In TestCli, the output from the command execution is in bytes. We need to convert this into a string to correctly compare with the expected output.

TestDaemon is not working as expected because the main() function is running and exiting before the HTTP server has a chance to start. This is because the rootCmd.Execute() function completes execution and allows the main() function to exit before startServer() is called. A way around this is to run startServer() as a goroutine within main() itself. However, for testing purposes, we need a way to stop the server once the tests have completed.

Let's make the necessary changes:

In main.go, modify the startServer() function and main() function as follows:

```go
func startServer(stop chan bool) {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc("/check/{password}", handler)
	http.Handle("/", r)
	
	srv := &http.Server{Addr: ":8080"}

	go func() {
		if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			// unexpected error. port in use?
			log.Fatalf("ListenAndServe(): %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// returning in a non-blocking way
	go func() {
		<-stop
		if err := srv.Shutdown(context.Background()); err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}()
}

func main() {
	rootCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolVarP(&daemonMode, "daemon", "d", false, "Start the password checker as a web server")

	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}

	if daemonMode {
		stop := make(chan bool)
		go startServer(stop)

		// Block main() until it's told to stop.
		<-stop
	}
}
```

Now, let's modify the test functions accordingly:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"os/exec"
	"strings"
	"testing"
	"time"
)

func TestCli(t *testing.T) {
	cmd := exec.Command("go", "run", "main.go", "password")
	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
	}

	expectedOutput := "0\n" // The password "password" is already strong
	if strings.TrimSpace(string(output)) != expectedOutput {
		t.Fatalf("Expected %v, got %v", expectedOutput, string(output))
	}
}

func TestDaemon(t *testing.T) {
	go func() {
		main()
	}()

	// Give the server a moment to start
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	resp, err := http.Get("http://localhost:8080/check/password")
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
	}

	expectedBody := "0"
	if strings.TrimSpace(string(body)) != expectedBody {
		t.Fatalf("Expected %v, got %v", expectedBody, string(body))
	}
}
```

Now, when you run go test, both tests should pass. Note that these are still more like integration tests, because they are testing the program as a whole, not just individual functions. Also, these tests depend on the main.go file being in the same directory as the tests.
